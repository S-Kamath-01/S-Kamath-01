## 🔥 About Me
I bridge the gap between **Rigorous Mathematical Modeling** and **Low-Latency Software Engineering**.
<br>
🔹 **Systems Engineering:** Focusing on memory management, concurrency, and high-performance **C++** architecture.
<br>
🔹 **Financial Data Science:** Building pipelines for time-series forecasting, volatility analysis, and backtesting using **Python, NumPy, and Pandas**.
<br>
🔹 **Database Architecture:** Architecting normalized databases (3NF) and writing high-efficiency queries using **Oracle SQL**.
<br>
🔹 **Core Mission:** Currently deep-diving into order matching algorithms, cache optimization, and algorithmic trading systems.

## 🚧 Currently Building (Spring 2026)
* **High-Performance Order Matching Engine (C++):** Designing a threaded matching engine using standard library algorithms. Currently profiling `std::map` vs. contiguous memory `std::vector` to minimize L1 cache misses and reduce order-matching latency.
* **Algorithmic Volatility Forecaster (Python):** Building an ARIMA-based pipeline to forecast NIFTY50 volatility with comprehensive 12-month backtesting.
